This script checks the ring of a lasso peptide and checks if it is a lasso or tadpole. If it is a lasso, it checks if it is right right-handed, or left-handed.

To run, we recommend using the text version of VMD:

_vmd -dispdev text -e latched_v1.tcl_

The script will create 3 text files showing the piercing calculation (if intersects or not), if the structure is pre-lasso or pre-tadpole, and if it is a pre-lasso - left or right hand.
